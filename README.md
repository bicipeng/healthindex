Whenever we attend a new clinic, we would be asked to fill out multiple forms regarding our medical histories.
If, unfortunately, a patient gets admitted to hospital and needs to do an operation, there would be at least 3 
groups of medicare workers come around asking about the patientâ€™s medical history. With HealthIndex, filling out
multiple forms or answering the same questions over and over is no longer needed. HealthIndex is a responsive 
patient management application that allows doctors to create QR Code with accurate patient medical information 
for each patient. Once the QR Codes are issued to patients, medical histories could be accessed by scanning the QR Codes.
